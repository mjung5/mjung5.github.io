My name is Min-Jung Jung. I am in the Applied Statistics & Data Management certificate program in NCSU and work part-time as a data evaluator at the NC DHHS. 

In my previous graduate program, where I majored in Child and Family Studies, I was trained to be an independent social science researcher. 

I studied the daily and overall experiences of children and families in culturally and geographically diverse contexts. Moreover, I focused on how socio-cultural interpersonal factors influence positive and negative outcomes of adolescence. Additionally, I have always been fascinated by the role of statistics and analytic methods and how they expand research questions and enrich research outcomes. 

Therefore, the training through the graduate certificate program will help me to enrich my skills on data analysis and management and to accomplish more than only my research interests. Eventually, I want to call myself a data scientist and a researcher.
