My name is Min-Jung Jung. I am in the Applied Statistics & Data Management certificate program in NCSU and work part-time as a data evaluator at the NC DHHS. 
In my previous graduate program, where I majored in Child and family studies, I was trained to be an independent social science researcher. I studied children and family's daily and overall experiences in culrurally and gegraphiccaly diverse context. Moreover, I focused on how socio cultral interpersonal factos influence positive and negative outcomes of adolesence. In the meantime, I have been always fascinated by the role of statistics and analytic methods and how it expands research questions and enriches research outcomes. Therefore, I decided to get more statistic/data science training and go beyond the scope of my research goal but also be a more effective data scientist.
