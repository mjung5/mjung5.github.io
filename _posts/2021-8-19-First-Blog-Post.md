title: From Statistician To Data Scientist
---

What do you think being a data scientist is about? 

My understanding of being a data scientist is that I will need a strong statistic background, but also need programming proficiency to handle big data and real-world data. Therefore, being a data scientist is beyond of being a statistician or a machine learning/data engineer and be able to implement adequate machine learning algorithms and provide statistical analysis to obtain crucial information from the collected data sets.  

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 

Not only should I be able to develop statistical models for analysis, but also be knowable of the tools and techniques like SQL databases, and programming languages, like Python and R. Moreover, I will need knowledge of using algorithms to extract data. In doing so, I can tackle down data from multiple sources and provide accurate predictions to make business decisions.

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 

Both statisticians and data scientists both investigate problems and analyze collected data to create forecasts. However, statisticians are more involved in smaller scale/manual data collection, hypothesis testing, and starting with relatively simple model (i.e. survey), like linear regression. On the other hand, data scientists deal with big data focusing on data ingestion and data cleaning and transformation, and use of SQL for data collection. Also, data scientists focus on software engineering practices like coding and machine leaning models.  

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

I have been trained to be a more statistician through my graduate school education. I collected my own data and analyzed with t-test and linear regression to test out hypotheses. However, I am ready to explore learning programing languages like R and handle big data from different sources and be able to provide insight information. I am definitely in a good position to expand my knowledge and be a data scientist.
