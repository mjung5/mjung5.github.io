```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.path = "../images/")

```
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
rmarkdown:: render("2021-9-11-Second-Blog-Post.Rmd",
                   output_format = "github_document",
                   output_dir = "../../repo/mjung5.github.io/_posts", 
                   output_options = list(html_preview = FALSE, keep_html = FALSE)
                   )

## R or SAS? R and SAS

Before I took R class, I thought that R will be similar to SAS, using syntax and getting statistic outcome. 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Example R Markdown output

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r iris, echo=FALSE}
plot(iris)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
